 In scholarly work requiring exact references, abbreviate titles that occur frequently, giving the full forms in an alphabetical list at the end. As a general practice, give the references in parenthesis or in footnotes, not in the body of the sentence. Omit the words <em>act</em>, <em>scene</em>, <em>line</em>, <em>book</em>, <em>volume</em>, <em>page</em>, except when</p></div> </div>
