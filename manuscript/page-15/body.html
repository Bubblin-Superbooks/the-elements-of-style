<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">omitted, as,</p><p>Brown, Shipley & Co.</p><p>Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas.</p><p>The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time, is to travel on foot.</p><p>This rule is difficult to apply; it is frequently hard to decide whether a single word, such as <em>however</em>, or a brief phrase, is or is not parenthetic. If the interruption to the flow of the sentence is but slight, the writer may safely omit the commas. But whether the interruption be slight or considerable, he must never insert one comma and omit the other. Such punctuation as</p><p>Marjorie's husband, Colonel Nelson paid us a visit yesterday,</p><p>or</p><p>My brother you will be pleased to hear, is now in perfect health,</p><p>is indefensible.</p></div> </div>
