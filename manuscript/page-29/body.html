<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Chapter III. Elementary Principles Of Composition</h4><p class="  start-chapter">Make the paragraph the unit of composition: one paragraph to each topic.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">If the subject on which you are writing is of slight extent, or if you intend to treat it very briefly, there may be no need of subdividing it into topics. Thus a brief description, a brief summary of a literary work, a brief account of a single incident, a narrative merely outlining an action, the setting forth of a single idea, any one of these is best written in a single paragraph.</p></div> </div>
